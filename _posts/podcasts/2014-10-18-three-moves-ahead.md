> I listen to podcasts all the time: commuting to work, doing the dishes, cooking breakfast, working in the yard. I have to be a bit picky because my commute isn't *that* long, and I don't really listen to them while I work, so I've got a finite amount of time each week. I wanted to share some of my favorites.

*Three Moves Ahead* was started by Troy Goodfellow as the official podcast of his blog, [Flash of Steel](http://flashofsteel.com/index.php/three-moves-ahead/); and he's usually joined by co-host [Rob Zacny](http://robzacny.com/). The subject is strategy games, both tabletop and digital. Required listening for any game designer with an interest in anything strategic or turn-based.
