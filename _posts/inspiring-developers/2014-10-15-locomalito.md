[Phaser](http://phaser.io) is one of the toolsets I'm currently experimenting with. The *News* section there led me to [L'Abbaye des mortes](https://github.com/luceraproject/abbaye-des-morts), an HTML5 port --- created with Phaser and open-sourced --- of an original game by [Locomalito](http://www.locomalito.com/). I instantly fell in love.

Locomalito's [passion for video games](http://www.locomalito.com/about.php) as art is contagious. Each of his games is lovingly handcrafted, with subjects slightly askew from the conventional. And his games are comprehensive projects, more than just the game itself, featuring many live action trailers and illustrated box covers. You can feel the love.
