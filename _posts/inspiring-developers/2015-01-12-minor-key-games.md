I first stumbled across [Eldritch](http://www.eldritchgame.com/), an FPS roguelike with a lo-fi aesthetic. It exists at an intersection of Wolfenstein 3-D, Minecraft, and Lovecraft. I immediately fell in love. I was then delighted to learn that the game was the work of a single developer, [David Pittman](https://twitter.com/dphrygian) -- code, art, and music! The soundtrack is wonderful, ambient, spooky stuff and is a regular for me while working. Even better? David has made the game's source code available -- hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to dig through it and write another *modeling games* post about it.

David's currently working on a political thriller stealth game, [Neon Struct](http://neonstruct.com/), which sounds super interesting, and is pretty honest about its ups and downs on [its blog](http://neonstruct.com/blog/). The title sequence gives a great vibe:

And JP LeBreton did a play through of a dev build:

Pittman is part of two-man team -- twins, in fact -- who form the studio [Minor Key Games](http://www.minorkeygames.com/). His brother, [J. Kyle Pittman](https://twitter.com/PirateHearts), made [two](http://www.piratehearts.com/blog/games/you-have-to-win-the-game/) [games](http://www.superwinthegame.com/) that ooze with NES sentimentality. They so closely and cleverly evoke all my favorites from that period -- Super Mario Bros. 2, Dragon Warrior, Metroid -- that I swear he's ripped tiles straight from the ROMs.

Continuing the retro goodness, Kyle is expanding the Super Win The Game engine for a new title, [Gunmetal Arcadia](http://gunmetalarcadia.com/wordpress/), and is documenting the process!

Even more retro delight, a discontinued project called [The Understory](http://www.piratehearts.com/blog/dead-games/the-understory/) makes me wanna go and build a Wolfenstein 3-D engine and start dropping in lo-res, ZX Spectrum-esque artwork:
