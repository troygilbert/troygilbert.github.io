As [mentioned before](http://troygilbert.com/ruts-and-tuts/), I've been trying to break out of a rut by following a [tutorial](https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon/read). Specifically, a tutorial to make a shoot 'em up in the vein of the classic 1942:

Well, I've finally completed the tutorial and I'm quite delighted by the results. You can [play it here](http://troygilbert.com/play/2015-01-12-yaws/). A real, honest to god, game, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. I want to take some next steps to make the game more my own:

* First, I'm gonna change of the art. New title page, new sprites.

* Second, I'm gonna change the sounds. Something to fit whatever new art I choose.

* Third, I'm gonna add some music. Because I wanna play with some simple music.

* Fourth, I'm gonna tweak some gameplay rules, e.g. scoring, speed, timing.

* Fifth (and ongoing), I want to add more enemies, more powerups, more boss battles.
