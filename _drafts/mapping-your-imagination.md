* Maps begin with a list of rooms. Rooms don't have to be actual rooms, they can be inside or outside. They are the discrete locations of the game. Everything takes place in a room.
* Make a list of rooms. Describe rooms with text? With pictures?
* Simple program that let's user visit any room in any order.
* To actually navigate the map we need connectivity information. For each room, we need to identify its exits. For each exit, we need to identify which room it leads to. This is our topology.
* Simple program that let's user visit any room in any order, and for each room also jump to the room identified by its available exits.
* Mention fully-connected maps, e.g. a grid of rooms?
* Mention serially-connected maps, e.g. sidescrollers?
* Mention that connections/exits are not necessarily bilateral.
