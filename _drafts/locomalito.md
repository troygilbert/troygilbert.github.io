This guy looks awesome: http://www.locomalito.com/

Very cool small games with a retro flare but a modern sensibility and some unconventional themes. Also, the presentation in the trailers (mixing live action footage with game footage) is really cool. Also love that each game page includes a bunch of extras like a game poster, DVD insert, etc. Love the vibe.

Do a quick blurb with video of all the games, point out that I found the site via https://github.com/luceraproject/abbaye-des-morts
